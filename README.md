# practices-in-24-winter
hope i can learn more this term  
id like to learn English, matlab and python this time.   
guess i would began my english learning from CET-4 and CET-6 volcabulary. I felt my English so poor when surfing the github haha  
and i will find a matlab course for a competition in summer? or read the book my father sent me, or just find its related course  
python i just wanna learn its basic grammar and just roughly can read that is enough?  
then i will try to study html+css+javascript.
