## CS50 NO.06  
* review the linklist and its basic operation  
* learn new structure: binary search tree  
  which belike:
  ```
  struct bitreenode{
    datatype data;
    struct bitreenode *nodel;
    struct bitreenode *noder;
  };
  ```
  a recursive data structure, left is smaller while right is bigger or what (just in the same logical system)
* new structure: hash table
  ```
  typedef struct hashnode{
    datatype data;
    struct hashnode *next;
  }node;
  node *table[n]; //every location of this array is a pointer lead to a small node
  
  #include<ctype.h>  //for toupper

  unsigned int hash(const char*word)  //const can ensure the fuction wouldn't change the original string, while unsigned to ensure its return value positive
  {
    return toupper(word[0]) - 'A';
  }
  ```
* new structure: trie // a tree of arrays
  ```
  typedef struct node
  {
    struct node *children[26];  //borrow the family tree metaphor
    char *number;  //storing a phone number of someone. if its not null, here is the end of someone's name
  }node;  //redefine every node of trie as a array of 26
  node *trie;
  //takes a huge amount of space
  ```
